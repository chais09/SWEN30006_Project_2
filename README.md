In this project, we continue working on a card game trainer, which developed using java.
Apply the proper object oriented design architecture and principle to implement additional functionalities to the application.

### Some Rules about Cribbage Card Game
• Cribbage is played with a standard fifty-two card deck with four suits and thirteen ranks in each suit.
• The game involves two players who play independently. The hand and score for Player 0 appears at the middle-top of the window, and the hand and score for Player 1 (the dealer) appears at the middle-bottom.

Cribbage is usually played until one of the players reaches a score of 121 points, with that player declared the winner. The game consists of a series of rounds, however the first player to reach 121 points wins immediately, even if this is in the middle of a round. Each round has clear rules about how play proceeds, and how and when points are scored. For this training system, we are interested only in playing one round, possibly multiple times over, to see how the choices made affect the scores.
